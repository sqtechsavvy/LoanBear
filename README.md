Thought for 6sLoanBear iOS App
Overview
LoanBear is a sample iOS application that simulates a friendly loan-providing service with a bear-themed interface. The app allows users to sign up, log in, and calculate loan details including total repayment and monthly payments based on a simple interest model (10% of principal per month). It demonstrates senior-level iOS development practices using SwiftUI, Combine, and MVVM architecture.
This app is for educational and demonstration purposes only. It uses mock authentication and a simplistic interest calculation. In a production environment, integrate with a secure backend (e.g., Firebase) and use realistic financial models.
Features

User Authentication: Secure login and signup with email and password (mocked for demo).
Loan Type Selection: Choose from Car Loan, Personal Loan, or Home Loan.
Loan Calculation:

Input principal amount and duration in months.
Computes total repayment: Principal + (Principal * 0.10 * Months).
Computes monthly payment: Total Repayment / Months.


Sign Out: Dedicated sign-out button after login.
Theming: Friendly bear icons using SF Symbols.
Best Practices:

MVVM architecture with ViewModels for business logic.
Dependency injection for services (e.g., AuthService).
Error handling and input validation.
Accessibility labels for UI elements.
Unit test stubs for key components.



Technologies Used

SwiftUI for declarative UI.
Combine for reactive programming and publishers.
Swift 5+.
Xcode 15+ (compatible with iOS 17+).

Installation

Clone the repository:
textgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/LoanBear.git

Open the project in Xcode:

Navigate to the project directory and open LoanBear.xcodeproj.


Build and run the app on a simulator or physical device.

No additional dependencies are required as it uses only standard Apple frameworks.
Usage

Launch the App: You'll see the login screen with a bear icon.
Sign Up or Log In:

Use test credentials: email test@example.com, password password for login.
For signup, provide a username, valid email, and password.


Loan Calculator:

After login, select a loan type.
Enter the loan amount (e.g., 1000) and duration in months (e.g., 12).
Tap "Compute Loan" to see total repayment and monthly payment.


Sign Out: Tap the "Sign Out" button in the navigation bar to return to the login screen.

Project Structure

Models: Defines User and LoanType.
AuthManager: Shared observable object for login state.
Services: Protocol-based auth service with mock implementation.
ViewModels: Separate VMs for login, signup, and loan calculation.
Views: SwiftUI views for login, signup, and calculator.
App Entry: LoanBearApp as the main scene.
Tests: Unit test stubs under #if DEBUG.

Limitations

Authentication is mocked; no real backend integration.
Interest calculation is simplistic (simple interest, not compound or amortized).
No persistent storage for user data.
Designed for iPhone; not optimized for iPad or landscape.
